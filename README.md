**We don't launch memes. We build YOUR ideas.**

MadFactory is a community-powered product launchpad on Solana. You submit an idea, the community votes, we build the winner, and the token launches on [Bags.fm](https://bags.fm) — with **30% of all trading fees going to the idea creator. Forever.**

## The Concept

Every day, thousands of ideas die because people don't know how to build them. MadFactory fixes that.

- You have an idea? **Submit it.**
- The community picks the best one? **We build it.**
- It launches as a token? **You earn 30% of every trade. Forever.**

No coding. No funding. No connections. Just your idea.

## How It Works

```
Submit idea --> Community votes (3 days) --> We build it --> Token launches on Bags --> You earn fees forever
```

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Submit** | Drop your product idea with a name, description, and category |
| **Vote** | The community votes for 3 days. One vote per person per round |
| **Build** | We build the winning idea into a real product |
| **Launch** | A token launches automatically on Bags.fm |
| **Earn** | The idea creator earns 30% of all trading fees. Forever |

---

## Fee Split

| Who | Share |
|-----|-------|
| Idea Creator | **30%** of all trading fees |
| MadFactory (Builder) | **70%** of all trading fees |

The creator earns passive income from every single trade on their token — no cap, no expiry, forever.
